# Shruti's Guide to the GRE

## First Steps
- Familiarize yourself with the exam format, timing, and scoring. 
  - **Verbal** is 2 sections, 20 questions each, 30 minutes each, 130-170 score range. Margin for error is small - first error is free, then each error costs you 1 point.
  
  - **Quant** is 2 sections, 20 questions each, 35 minutes each, 130-170 score range. Can't afford to get anything wrong.


### Class Profiles
Around 30% of admitted students took the GRE. 

- [HBS](https://www.hbs.edu/mba/admissions/class-profile/Pages/default.aspx): 163V, 163Q (median); 170V, 170Q (75th percentile)
- [Stanford](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/programs/mba/admission/class-profile): 164V, 163Q (median); 170V, 170Q (75th percentile)
- [Wharton](https://mba.wharton.upenn.edu/class-profile/): 162V, 162Q; 170V, 170Q (75th percentile)

You need to aim for close to 170 on both sections.

## Study Plan
- Read all of the [Official Guide](./General/GRE_Official.pdf), especially Section 7 (Math Review). Focus on reading, not solving. Relax.
- Then, go through [Quant](#quant) and [Verbal](#verbal-section) and sections one-by-one.
- In the last 2-3 weeks, take as many practice tests as possible. If you run out, find more practice problems (reach out to ur bro for that).
- I also like [Princeton Review](./General/Princeton_Review.pdf); it's very readable from cover-to-cover.

Note: all "strategies" touted by others are bullshit. Your IQ is high enough to implicitly figure out the best strategy for yourself, if you prepare enough.

## Verbal Section

- Practice, practice, practice. Don't spend any time reading "strategies" or question types. 
  
- Practice from 
  - [Official Guide](./Verbal/Official_GRE_Verbal.pdf)
  - [Princeton Review](./General/Princeton_Review.pdf)
  - [Kaplan](./Verbal/Kaplan.pdf)
  -  [Manhattan Prep](./Verbal/Manhattan_Prep.pdf).
  
- Don't sweat vocab, it usually counts for just a couple of questions on the exam. Use the following lists (in decreasing order of priority):
  - [Barron's 333](./Vocab/Barrons_333.pdf)
  - [Barron's 800](./Vocab/Barrons_800.pdf)
  - [Magoosh](./Vocab/Magoosh.pdf)
  - [Gregmat](./Vocab/Gregmat.pdf)


### Reading
- Read the [The New Yorker](https://t.me/newyorkercom) on your phone while pooping.

--- 
## Quant
- Solve problems (especially from Manhattan Prep):
  - [Official GRE Quant](./Quant/Official_GRE_Quant.pdf)
  - [Manhattan Prep 5-lbs Book](./General/Manhattan_Prep_5lbs.pdf)
  - [Princeton Review](./Quant/Princeton_Review.pdf)
  - [Kaplan](./Quant/Kaplan.pdf)

- If feeling dumb about a topic, look at the folder for that topic in [Emergency](./Quant/EMERGENCY)
  
- **Important**: if stuck at a problem, check the answer or Google it immediately. Don't spend more than 2 minutes on a problem. 

## AWA
- Not important at all; read this in the last 2-3 days.
- Read the sample essays from the [Official Guide](./GRE_Official.pdf). Practice an essay or two. Write in a cocky, American, confident tone; use plenty of examples.
